These components can be modified, flexed, and used however works best for your use case. I will try to highlight some example use cases, but the important thing to note
is that the code you copy and paste is yours.

## Compatibility

This registry only officially supports [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) projects today, but there are plans to support additional frameworks, starting with Vite / TanStack Start.

| Framework       | Version(s) | Support    |
| --------------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| Next.js         | 14, 15, 16 | ✅ Full    |
| Tanstack Router | N/A        | ⚠️ Partial |

## Prerequisites

### Configure Clerk

Full Clerk quickstart documentation can be found available [here.](https://clerk.com/docs/nextjs/getting-started/quickstart)

1. Install Clerk

```npm
npm install @clerk/nextjs
```

2. Hook up Proxy (Middleware on Next.js 15 and below)

```tsx title="proxy.ts"
import { clerkMiddleware } from "@clerk/nextjs/server"; // [!code highlight]

export const config = {
  matcher: [
    // Skip Next.js internals and all static files, unless found in search params
    "/((?!_next|[^?]*\\.(?:html?|css|js(?!on)|jpe?g|webp|png|gif|svg|ttf|woff2?|ico|csv|docx?|xlsx?|zip|webmanifest)).*)",
    // Always run for API routes
    "/(api|trpc)(.*)",
  ],
};

export default clerkMiddleware(); // [!code highlight]
```

3. Add a `ClerkProvider` to the Root Layout of your project

```tsx title="layout.tsx"
import { ClerkProvider } from "@clerk/nextjs"; // [!code highlight]

export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode;
}) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>
        // [!code highlight]
        <ClerkProvider>
          <main>{children}</main>
          // [!code highlight]
        </ClerkProvider>
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

4. A `.env` or `.env.local` file must be present with your `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` and `CLERK_SECRET_KEY`, which can be found on the Clerk dashboard.

```ts title=".env"
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY = "pk_test_xxx";
CLERK_SECRET_KEY = "sk_test_xxx";
```

### Configure shadcn/ui

1. Install `shadcn/ui`

```npm
npx shadcn@latest init
```

2. Download `sonner` component

```npm
npx shadcn@latest add sonner
```

3. Add `<Toaster />` to your Root Layout

```tsx title="layout.tsx"
import { ClerkProvider } from "@clerk/nextjs";
import { Toaster } from "@/components/ui/sonner"; // [!code highlight]

export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode;
}) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>
        <ClerkProvider>
          <main>{children}</main>
          // [!code highlight]
          <Toaster />
        </ClerkProvider>
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

Once this setup has been completed, you are ready to begin copying components.

## Usage

After finding a component you'd like to use, copy the installation command relevant to your project's package manager (npm, pnpmn, yarn, or bun)
and execute it in the terminal. The shadcn registry will automatically install dependencies and relevant files into your project.

Once a component has been installed, refer to the usage guide on it to see examples of how it can be used.
